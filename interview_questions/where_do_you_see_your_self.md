Where do you see yourself in next five years ?

Option 1: (Best for freshers)

In five years, I see myself as a skilled professional who has grown with the company, taken on more responsibility, and is contributing strongly to team goals.


Option 2: (Learning-focused)

In five years, I want to be technically strong, confident in my role, and trusted to handle important tasks while continuing to learn.


Option 3: (Balanced & mature)

I see myself growing step by step—improving my skills, understanding the business better, and adding more value to the organization.


Option 4: (Leadership-safe, not overconfident)

I hope to be in a position where I can guide juniors, take ownership of work, and contribute to larger projects
