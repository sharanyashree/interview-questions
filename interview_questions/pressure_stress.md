how will you handle pressure and stress?

PRESSURE:

When I feel pressure, I first stay calm and understand what needs to be done. I break the work into smaller tasks, prioritize the important ones, and focus on completing them one step at a time.

STRESS:

When I feel stressed, I pause and identify what’s causing it. I organize my tasks, focus on one thing at a time, and avoid overthinking. If needed, I take short breaks or ask for clarification early. This helps me stay balanced and continue working effectively.
