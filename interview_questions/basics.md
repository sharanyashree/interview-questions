1. Tell me about yourself?

SIMPLE VERSION TO INTRODUCE YOURSELF IS :

“Good morning sir/ma’am. My name is [Name]. I’ve recently completed my [Degree] in [Branch] from [College]. During my studies, I worked on a project on [project topic], where I gained hands-on experience with [key skills/tools]. I also completed [internship/course/activity], which helped me improve my problem-solving and teamwork skills. I’m interested in the role of [role/field] because I enjoy working on [relevant interest], and I’m looking forward to starting my career in a company where I can learn, contribute, and grow.”

IN SHORTER WE CAN SAY LIKE:

“Good morning sir/ma’am. I’m [Name], a [Branch] graduate from [College]. I’ve worked on a project related to [topic] and gained experience in [skills]. I’m interested in [role] and excited to learn and grow in a professional environment.”


When an interviewer says, “Tell me about yourself,” they’re not asking for your life story, your marks, or your family background. What they really want to know is simple:
– Can you communicate clearly?
– Do you actually know your subject?
– Are you serious about the job?
So keep your answer calm, clear, and connected to the role.

Here’s how you can build a solid response step by step:
Step 1: Start with who you are.
Begin with your name and education. This sets the stage.
Example: “Good morning, sir/ma’am. My name is ___, and I’ve recently completed my ___ in ___ from ___.”

Step 2: Talk about what you did, not just what you studied.
Share a project or activity that shows you applied your knowledge.
Example: “During my academics, I worked on a project on ___, where I gained hands-on experience with ___.”

Step 3: Add your extra exposure.
Mention internships, workshops, or online courses that helped you upskill.
Example: “I also completed ___, which helped me improve my teamwork and problem-solving skills.”

Step 4: Explain what interests you.
Link your interests to the role.
Example: “I’m interested in ___ because I enjoy working on ___.”

Step 5: End with a professional goal.
Wrap it up by showing enthusiasm to learn and grow.
Example: “I’m looking forward to starting my career where I can learn, contribute, and grow.”
When you put it all together, your answer sounds structured and genuine — not memorized or mechanical.

Common Mistakes to Avoid:
– Don’t speak too fast.
– Don’t sound like you rehearsed a speech.
– Don’t add unnecessary personal details.
– Don’t end weakly — finish with confidence.

Final tip: Speak slowly, make eye contact, and pause for a moment after each sentence. Practice it out loud at least three times.
